# libdatachannel - client-benchmark

This directory contains a native client to open Data Channels with WebSocket signaling using libdatachannel and benchmark functionalities. It offers three functionalities;
- Benchmark: Bi-directional data transfer benchmark (Also supports One-Way testing)
- Constant Throughput Set: Send desired amount of data per second
- Multiple Data Channel: Create desired amount of data channel 

## Start Signaling Server
- Start one of the signaling server from the examples folder. For example start  `signaling-server-nodejs` like;
  - `cd examples/signaling-server-nodejs/`
  - `npm i`
  - `npm run start `

## Start `client-benchmark` Applications

Start 2 applications by using example calls below. Then copy one of the client's ID and paste to the other peer's screen to start offering process.

## Usage Examples

### Benchmark for 300 seconds

> `./client-benchmark -d 300` 

Example Output (Offering Peer's Output);
